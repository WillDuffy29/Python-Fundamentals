# Python-Fundamentals
A collection of small Python programs created to practice core programming concepts as a beginner. These exercises focus on user input, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, and basic problem-solving.

INCLUDED PROGRAMS

1. Pythagoras Calculator
Calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using user-provided side lengths.

2. Quadratic Formula Calculator
Solves quadratic equations using the standard formula.  

3. Coin Flip Demo
Simulates a coin flip using random numbers.  

4. Cyclone Exercise
Determines whether a user can ride a roller coaster based on height and credits.

HOW TO RUN

- Install Python onto your system
- Download the desired file and run inside your terminal
- Follow the on-screen prompts

CONCEPTS PRACTICED

- Variables and data types
- User input handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Using Python standard libraries (random)
- Program flow and simple logic

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Add error handling for invalid input (e.g. letters instead of numbers)
- Use functions to modularize code and avoid repetition
- Combine multiple programs into a menu-driven interface
- Later, adapt logic for front-end applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

NOTES

These programs were created as part of my beginner Python learning journey. Each project demonstrates foundational coding skills and problem-solving ability, and collectively they demonstrate my understanding of coding as it progresses from simple calculations to interactive, multi-step programs.
